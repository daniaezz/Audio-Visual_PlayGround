# Audio-Visual Playground
## [Demo link](https://youtu.be/kssfjLcW3gk)

### Concept

Taking inspiration from examples of music visialisations, I wanted to create a musical visualiser that would represent all the sounds in one shape/entity rather than represent the notes or sounds are seperate elements. I also wanted the user to be able to choose their own music and generate a visualisation based on their input. From there stemmed the idea to create a playground where the user will be able to create a song of their liking based on a set of available sounds. Each sound would have its own musical visiualisation and when combined together they would affect each other, to be seen as one rather than individual sounds.


### Sounds
There are a total of 5 sounds available to the user ( 2 piano based sounds, 2 drums and a bass guitar) and they can combine them in different ways to create their own story. The only sound playing at the beginning of the application is the softer piano sound, from there the user can choose to add or remove sounds based on their liking. The story starts building up as the user experiments with different sounds and how they work together till they reach an outcome that they are satisfied with. The sounds are all constantly playing simultaneously at the start of the application and the gui controls the volume. This was done so that the music would stay in sync and to avoid having individual sounds playing off-beat. The music visualisation would appear only if the volume is greater than 0.
